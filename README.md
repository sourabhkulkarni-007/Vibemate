## Problem Statement:
New college students often struggle to find compatible roommates who align with their lifestyle preferences, such as sleep schedule, cleanliness, study habits, and social behavior. 
Without a structured matching process, students frequently rely on chance or limited information, leading
to mismatches that can affect comfort, productivity, and mental well-being during their initial
transition to college life.

## Task
1. Design a minimalistic mobile app that helps new students find suitable roommates based on shared preferences.
2. The app should use the minimum number of screens/windows necessary to guide users from sign-up to roommate matching, ensuring a smooth and intuitive onboarding process. Focus on simplicity, clarity, and ease of use, especially for first-time users unfamiliar with the college environment.

## Objectives for Product Development
1. Create User Personas for the user audience of your app.
2. A list of all features, along with their detailed description and their use cases (minimum 2)
3. A low-fidelity / mock-up level wireframe of all the necessary screens
